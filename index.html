Hello, my name is Haley!<br>
    My major is nursing and I enjoy field hockey and concerts, my favorite concert is Pitbull.<br>
    I dont play games as much now but I used to play Just Dance, Mario Kart and Wii Sports.<br>
    Something that is important to me is my education.<br>
    The reason I am taking this class is out of all the core classes, this one intrested me the most.<br>
    I have no knowledge of Queer games.<br>
